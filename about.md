I'm a web developer working at [<del>Wijs</del>](https://wijs.be), [Engagor](https://engagor.com) as a backend developer.
I love working in Vim and I rarely leave my command line behind.
As a side project I'm also working on [Grabblr](http://grabblr.com), which is kind
of a social wishlisting web application worth checking out (Duh).

Since I'm a soccer enthusiast I'm following the Premier League in my spare time,
supporting Liverpool FC. And when the weather is alright I'm out there on my race bike.
If you'd like you can track my rides on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/276614).
